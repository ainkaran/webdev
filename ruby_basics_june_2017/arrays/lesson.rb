# Write an array that contains three strings and three numbers

arr = ['First string', 1, 'Second string', 2, 'Third String', 3]

# Accessing values in a ruby can be done with #[] notation
arr[0] # returns 'First string'

# Multi dimensional arrays
# An array whose elements are all arrays  is multi-dimensional array
# it can be used to represent a table or a matrix
a = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9,10]]

# You can access array elements of nested arrays by chaining
# the bracket notation

a[1] # returns  [4, 5, 6]
a[0][1] # returns 2
a[-1][-1] # returns 10

# The bracket notation when combined with = can be used to
# assign a value
a[1][-1] = 16 # replaces the value 6 in the nested array with 16
a[-1] = [20, 30] # replaces the last array with [20, 30]

b = ['Sun', 'Moon']
# To add values at the end of an array use the << (shovel operator) or
# .push method. They function identically, return the array and mutate it
# as well

b << 'Earth' << 'Alpha Centauri'
# returns ['Sun', 'Moon', 'Earth', 'Alpha Centauri']
b.push('Earth').push('Alpha Centauri') # same as above
# << and push can be chained one after the other

# use the method .include? to check if an array contains a value
b.include? 'Earth' # returns true
b.include? 20 # returns false

# Find a method to turn a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array
a.flatten

# Find out how to add and remove elements from the end of arrays and from
# beginnings of arrays
a.shift # remove from the beginning
a.unshift(1) # add 1 to the beginning
a.pop # remove from the end
